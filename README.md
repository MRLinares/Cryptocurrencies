# Cryptocurrencies
## Objective
Create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system. 

> Resources:<br>
> Data: crypto_data.csv<br>
> Software: Python, Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, Pandas, Plotly, SKLearn

## Results

* Data cleaning in preparation for training.
* Reduce dimensions using principal component analysis.
* Use Kmeans for clustering.
* Plot

The images below give a snapshot of the processes that took place in the steps above in order to create a classification system using unsupervised machine learning.
